Is a new form of sonic weapon being used against U.S. Embassy personnel in Cuba?  Despite having occurred several months ago, the U.S. government is still at a loss to characterize the disturbing attack against embassy personnel and is considering closing the embassy.

FedEx misses earnings - while some of the earnings miss can be attributed to heavy weather, the FedEx quarterly filing acknowledges the NotPetya ransomware had a material impact on earnings.  The damage, mostly contained within their TNT Express subsidiary highlights the impact ransomware can have on "just in time" business operations and their associated supply chains.
